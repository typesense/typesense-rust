**drop_tokens_threshold** | Option<**i32**> | If the number of results found for a specific query is less than this number, Typesense will attempt to drop the tokens in the query until enough results are found. Tokens that have the least individual hits are dropped first. Set to 0 to disable. Default: 10  | [optional]
**enable_overrides** | Option<**bool**> | If you have some overrides defined but want to disable all of them during query time, you can do that by setting this parameter to false  | [optional][default to false]

Eg: to hide records with IDs 123 and 456, you'd specify `123,456`. You could also use the Overrides feature to override search results based on rules. Overrides are applied first, followed by `pinned_hits` and finally `hidden_hits`.  | [optional]
**highlight_affix_num_tokens** | Option<**i32**> | The number of tokens that should surround the highlighted text on each side. Default: 4  | [optional]

**infix** | Option<**String**> | If infix index is enabled for this field, infix searching can be done on a per-field basis by sending a comma separated string parameter called infix to the search query.

**max_extra_prefix** | Option<**i32**> | There are also 2 parameters that allow you to control the extent of infix searching max_extra_prefix and max_extra_suffix which specify the maximum number of symbols before or after the query that can be present in the token. For example query \"K2100\" has 2 extra symbols in \"6PK2100\". By default, any number of prefixes/suffixes can be present for a match. | [optional]
**max_extra_suffix** | Option<**i32**> | There are also 2 parameters that allow you to control the extent of infix searching max_extra_prefix and max_extra_suffix which specify the maximum number of symbols before or after the query that can be present in the token.

**offset** | Option<**i32**> | Identifies the starting point to return hits from a result set. Can be used as an alternative to the page parameter. | [optional]

An example use case would be to feature or promote certain items on the top of search results. A list of `record_id:hit_position`. Eg: to include a record with ID 123 at Position 1 and another record with ID 456 at Position 5, you'd specify `123:1,456:5`. You could also use the Overrides feature to override search results based on rules. Overrides are applied first, followed by `pinned_hits` and finally `hidden_hits`.  | [optional]
